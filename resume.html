            It is generally recommended to use the same CSS file for multiple pages in your personal website, rather than creating a separate CSS file for each page. This approach is known as a "single CSS file" or "shared CSS file" strategy.

There are several reasons why using a single CSS file is a good idea:

Reduced maintenance: By using a single CSS file, you only need to make changes in one place, rather than having to update multiple files. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors.
Improved performance: A single CSS file can be cached by the browser, which means that it only needs to be downloaded once. This can improve the performance of your website, especially for users who return to your site multiple times.
Better organization: Using a single CSS file can help keep your code organized and easy to maintain. It can also make it easier to find and reuse code snippets across your website.
Simplified deployment: With a single CSS file, you only need to upload one file to your server, rather than multiple files. This can simplify the deployment process and reduce the risk of errors.
However, there may be situations where it makes sense to use a separate CSS file for certain pages. For example, if you have a page that requires a lot of custom styling, it may be better to create a separate CSS file for that page. This can help keep your code organized and make it easier to maintain.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use a single CSS file or multiple CSS files will depend on the specific needs of your website and your personal preferences.
