            Hey there! I'm Uka. I grew up in Denver, CO after immigrating from Mongolia with my parents as a toddler. At the age of 8, I fell in love with the sound of the violin and for the next decade, I immersed myself in the world of music. My passion led me to attend an arts-focused middle and high school.

            But alas, when it came time for college, I headed to Brown University and I took a detour from classical music to study economics and finance. It felt like a safe bet, you know? And after graduating in 2019, I dove headfirst into the world of finance, working as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley in bustling San Francisco. Later on, I even had the opportunity to join the team that manages Harvard University's massive endowment. It's been crazy!

            While I've enjoyed my time in finance, I've always had this burning desire to explore my creative side. In January of 2024, I decided to take a sabbatical and do some soul searching while diving deep into the wondrous world of UX/UI design! It's like discovering a whole new universe, and I couldn't be more thrilled.           
        </p>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="description">
      My aim is to document my design adventure and highlight other insights gained during my sabbatical here. Stay tuned!
