            Hey there! I'm Uka. I'm originally from Mongolia but grew up in Denver, CO. When I was 8, I picked up the violin and for the next decade, I immersed myself in music and attended a performing arts middle and high school. When it came time for college, I headed to Brown University and I took a detour from classical music to study economics. After graduating in 2019, I dove into the world of finance, first working as a banker in SF and then moving eastward to join the team that manages Harvard's massive endowment. While I enjoyed my time working, I felt a growing desire to lean back into my creative side. In February of 2024, I decided to take some time off and learn cool things like UX/UI design and web development, and express myself through writing here and on my new movie review blog at filmlandia.net. When I'm not hunched over my laptop, I'm at the gym or at a movie theater. I'm always down to chat about any of the above and/or learn something new!
            
            I'm at ukabattulga [at] gmail [dot] com.
